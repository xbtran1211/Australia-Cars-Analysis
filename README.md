## Beginner Friendly Exploratory Australia Cars Analysis

This small project serves to be practice exercise to help me apply the data cleaning, wrangling, and visualisation skills. This dataset was retrieve from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/australia-car-market-data). Credit goes to the owner of the dataset, Lai Ng, for creating and maintaining such high quality. 

To be honest, I'm kinda stuck here as I did not know how to proceed after answering all the exploratory questions, I was supposed to perform some predictive or prescriptive analysis, but since my ability is limited on those, I will continue the project on another day.
